# WikiMaps: A Lighthouse Labs Midterm Production

![wikimap logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thornrose/WikiMap/master/wikimap.png)

Brought to you by [Willliam Wadman](https://github.com/WilWadman), [Max Hur](https://github.com/doublefriedtofu) and [Cheever Esler](https://github.com/Thornrose). The project was built off of a [node skeleton](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/node-skeleton) provided by Lighthouse Labs, utilizing [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and a few of its compatible tile layer providers.

The midterm overall required the following stack, along with a list of possible projects:

- ES6 for server-side (NodeJS) code
- NodeJS
- Express
- RESTful routes
- One or more CSS or UI "framework"s
- jQuery
- A CSS preprocessor such as SASS, Stylus, or PostCSS for styling -- or CSS Custom properties and no CSS preprocessor
- PostgreSQL and pg (with promises) for DBMS
- git for version control

The project we chose to work on was the "Wiki Map" option, which also came along with a set of requirements in order to reach a minimum viable product:

- users can see a list of the available maps
- users can view a map
- a map can contain many points
- each point can have: a title, description, and image
- authenticated users can create maps
- authenticated users can modify maps (add, edit, remove points)
- users can favourite a map
- users have profiles, indicating their favourite maps and maps they've contributed to
- use http://leafletjs.com/ or https://developers.google.com/maps/

## Dependencies
node.js with
- chalk
- cookie-session
- cors
- dotenv
- ejs
- express
- morgan
- pg
- sass

optional:
- nodemon


## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo into a new directory. You will need to have access to a postgres database.
2. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
4. Install dependencies: `npm i`
5. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
6. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`




## How To Use the App
![main page]()

 From the main page, the layer icon ![layer icon]() can be used to render different tile layers on the map. An unauthenticated user is still able to see a list of available maps via link in the top right corner.

![available maps]()

From the available maps page, manual navigation is required in order to view each map. Users would simply replace `all` in the url with a chosen map number and hit enter/return to navigate to a specific map. 

Each map has a set of points on it that the user will be able to select and view some information related to that point (including a title, description and image), but they will not be able to edit or delete anything. Clicking on the map will simply popup a prompt to log in.

For the purposes of this project, the login/authentication layer was not a top priority. To log in, a user would navigate back to the home directory `http://localhost:8080/`, enter a number between 1 and 5 in the login bar at the top right and hit `Log in`.

Once logged in, a few more options will be displayed: 
- a button to add the current map to a 'favourits' collection.
- a nav link to see your list of favourited maps (and any maps that the user has added points to).
- a nav link to create a brand new map.

Creating a new map will render a new instance of a map with no pre-existing points on it.

Now, when the map is clicked, a form will be displayed to add a new point. **ðŸŸ¡ NOTE ON CURRENT BUG ðŸŸ¡**: a valid image link must be used in the image url, otherwise later on, selecting that point will crash the server.

![existing point]() ![add point]() 

Any point on any map can also now be edited or deleted at will!
