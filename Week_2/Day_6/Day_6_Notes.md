# Week 2, Day 1 (Day 6)

## Coming up: Asynchronous programming
- dealing with file system, networking

## Title Case Kata - 
- what did I learn.
- go for the simple solution first, don't necessarily try solutions you don't fully understand.
- when you use `for..in` on a string, it returns the value of the index of the character... as a string

## intro to async
- callback becomes a literal callback, like when you call a bank and there's too many people in line ahead
- flow control
- set timeout syntax `setTimeout(callback, delay)`
- dont forget about callbacks being defined inline... and they don't always take arks...AHHHHH
