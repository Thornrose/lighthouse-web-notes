# Day 2
## Pair Programming
- driver writes (focusing deeply on coding), navigator reviews (and brings ideas, looks up solutions, confirms syntax, etc). True teamwork
- sounds like this can be done with VScode live share

### Why Pair?
- Approach - helps with planning and tactics

- Eases the workload - many hands make light work, one person code, the other checks syntax (great when studying a new language?)
- Confidence, affirmation - more assurance when trying new things, always have a ready second opinion
- Code quality - errors more likely to be caught - skills transfer between the two programmers
- Verbalizing - huge, being able to communicate the ideas clearly is ey in this process, vauluable in many contexts (teaching, interviews, etc)
- Waste less time - we are eachother's keepers, less likely to get distracted or spend too long on a problem

### The Darker Side
- Ego, Impostor syndrome, Competiton, Blame, Alone/Togerther - all issues that can be avoided with right attitude

- listen to and trust eachother
- boost eachother's strengths, build upon weak points
- no point tracking who did what, as long as you both can understand the code
- careful not to JUST use eachother for questions. both take active role in communication
- when driving, program "out loud" always describing what you are doing, ask questions
- when navigating, close/minimize your editor and keep web docs (MDN) and google at the ready

## Lecture (with Dominic Tremblay)
- most notes scratched on paper for this. 
- Dominic likes questions as we go, not wait for end
