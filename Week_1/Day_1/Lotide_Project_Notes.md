# Lotide Project
## Libraries
- a collection of code that can be re-used in multiple projects, vs. having to write new code every time
- can be public or private
- jQuery and Bootstrap are some examples of public libraries
- Lotide project will be based on [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
- _side note: stars on gitHub indicate popularity_

## Assert function
- `console.assert()` shows an error message in console - easy way to implelemt error checking? yep
- _side note: this is running in node - can have multiple terminal instances open - could keep node open in order to maintain a function that was created there._
- we can set up our own file that functions this way - ours is better becuase it will **also** give us a result if the assertion is correct, whereas console.assert() qill ouput nothing in those cases
