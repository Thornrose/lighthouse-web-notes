# Ruby: ActiveRecord

- a part of Rails meant to help define database models

AR exercise:

stores:

- id (int)
- name (str)
- annual_revenue (int)
- mens_apparel (bool)
- womens_apparel (bool)
- created_at
- updated_at 

employees:

- id (int)
- store_id (int)
- first_name (str)
- last_name (str)
- hourly_rate (int)
- created_at
- updated_at 

## Getting started with Rails

`rails new` app - directories:

---
| File/Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| app/| Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers, channels, jobs, and assets for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide. |
| bin/ | Contains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to set up, update, deploy, or run your application.
| config/ | Contains configuration for your application's routes, database, and more. This is covered in more detail in Configuring Rails Applications. |
| config.ru | Rack configuration for Rack-based servers used to start the application. For more information about Rack, see the Rack website. |
| db/ | Contains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations. |
| Gemfile, Gemfile.lock | These files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem. For more information about Bundler, see the Bundler website. |
| lib/ | Extended modules for your application. |
| log/ | Application log files. |
| package.json | This file allows you to specify what npm dependencies are needed for your Rails application. This file is used by Yarn. For more information about Yarn, see the Yarn website. |
| public/ | Contains static files and compiled assets. When your app is running, this directory will be exposed as-is. |
| Rakefile | This file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing Rakefile, you should add your own tasks by adding files to the lib/tasks directory of your application. |
| README.md | This is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on. |
| storage/ | Active Storage files for Disk Service. This is covered in Active Storage Overview. |
| test/ | Unit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus. These are covered in Testing Rails Applications. |
| tmp/ | Temporary files (like cache and pid files). |
| vendor/ | A place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems. |
| .gitignore | This file tells git which files (or patterns) it should ignore. See GitHub - Ignoring files for more info about ignoring files. |
| .ruby-version | This file contains the default Ruby version. |

start rails server with `rails s`

to get started you need at minimum: 
- a `route` (maps request to controller action)
- a `controller` with an `action` (performs necessary work to handle request, prepares data for view)
- a `view` (displays data)

step 1: add something to `config/routes.rb`

then look in the `controllers` folder - ah heck, we're just doing it

The `<% %>` tag means "evaluate the enclosed Ruby code." The `<%= %>` tag means "evaluate the enclosed Ruby code, and output the value it returns."

- seems like you need to restart server after a migration

The `link_to` helper renders a link with its first argument as the link's text and its second argument as the link's destination.

## MVC (Model-View-Controller)

- The browser issues a request for the /users URL.
- Rails routes /users to the `index` action in the Users controller.
- The `index` action asks the User model to retrieve all users (`User.all`).
- The User model pulls all the users from the database.
- The User model returns the list of users to the controller.
- The controller captures the users in the `@users` variable, which is passed to the `index` view.
- The view uses embedded Ruby to render the page as HTML.
- The controller passes the HTML back to the browser.
