# Thursday Week 5
## more LightBnB
- refactoring `getUserWithEmail`, `getUserWithId` and `addUser`

- doing the 2nd round on all properties is REALLY interesting. making a seach with various options

- actually really cool.

## You Vs. Database
- i skimmed this earlier and i get what it's saying - technically yes we could interface with a database with JS only, but why would you? using SQL can make it way easier
- Yeah - use SQL to query, not JS. SQL is literally made for it
- don't always just take stack overflow for its first results... think about the problem yourself
