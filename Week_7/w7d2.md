## Modern UI Development
-  "Modern UI development is about component-based Single Page Apps (SPAs)"

button example: instead of having different CSS all in one file for every possible version of a button, you can link the css to modules and have it tied to different button types and states. keeps things simpler

the states:
- **Base** uses no props and is considered the default button
- **Confirm** uses the `confirm` prop to apply the `.button--confirm` modifier class
- **Danger** uses the `danger` prop to apply the `.button--danger` modifier class
- **Clickable** uses the `onClick` prop to handle the button click event
- **Disabled** uses the `disabled` prop to apply the `disabled` attribute to the button element

we will use CSS `:hover` selector to define styles on hover: this can be done through react but is much harder than we need to get into right now

- each prop will be set to either true or false, and we can use a shorthand to do so
- button text will be generated dynamically with `props.children`

looks like we're starting to get to a place where `let` over `const` actually is getting some use

- if using conditional to append classes, make sure to add whitespace where necessary
- remember that the attributes you use in JSX will reolve to HTML, but scertain things are in camelCase / differ slightly from the regular html attribute names

Storybook: has an addon to be able to register events IN storybook. not by default which is interesting

in normal html we could just use "disabled" attribute, but in React we need to pass it as a prop, same with onClick

## Conditional classNames
- there is a `classNames` function that makes this cleaner
