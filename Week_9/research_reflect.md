Express vs. `Fastify`: 
- intro:
  - talk about popularity of express, when it came out, when node came out
  - popularity vs all others (pic from npmtrends)
  - just because express is popular, does not mean it's always better
  - take a look at Fastify
- body:
  - introduce fastify and compare
- conclusion:
  - how to make choices: express has bigger community / more history, more answers to questions. newer packages like fastifymay need you to do more of your own research and experimentation.
